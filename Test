Searching repositories
You can search for repositories on GitHub and narrow the results using these repository search qualifiers in any combination.

You can search for repositories globally across all of GitHub, or search for repositories within a particular organization. For more information, see "About searching on GitHub."

To include forks in the search results, you will need to add fork:true or fork:only to your query. For more information, see "Searching in forks."

Tips:

For a list of search syntaxes that you can add to any search qualifier to further improve your results, see "Understanding the search syntax".
Use quotations around multi-word search terms. For example, if you want to search for issues with the label "In progress," you'd search for label:"in progress". Search is not case sensitive.
